Forever

Forever we remain oblivious to the future,
 lost to the past and enduring our torture.
 Forever we take chances to settle our scores,
 losing some battles and winning some wars. ...

Camouflaged

In all chaotic beauty lies a wounded work of art.
 Beautiful but torn, wreaking havoc on my heart.
 Camouflaged by insecurities, blinded by it all.
 I love the way you sit there and barely notice me at all.

Little Baby

Little baby Oh so small
 One day you will be big and tall
 I watch you while you laugh and play
 My love for you grows everyday ...
